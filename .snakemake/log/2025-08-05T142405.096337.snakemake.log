MissingOutputException in rule figure1 in file /home/sj/repos/manuscript_beta2_single_fiber_snakemake/snakefile, line 151:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/figures/figure1/test.svg
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
