MissingOutputException in rule figure1 in file /home/sj/repos/manuscript_beta2_single_fiber_snakemake/snakefile, line 150:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 60 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/myh_distribution.csv
data/figures/figure1/myh_distribution.svg
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
