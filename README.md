# 🐳 Snakemake + Docker Pipeline for Proteomics Analysis

This repository contains the code and data to reproduce the analysis from an unpublished study on β2-agonist treatment combined with resistance training and their effects on the skeletal muscle proteome in
type I and IIa muscle fibers, respectively.

The repository is designed to be executed as a **Snakemake workflow** inside a **Docker container**. Inside the docker container, [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) manages R package dependencies. In this way, the project is reproducible and easily useable across systems. 

You do **not need to install R or any R packages** locally — everything is self-contained within the Docker image.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Run the Analysis in Docker)

To reproduce the full analysis in a portable and reproducible environment:

### 1. 📥 Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/s-jessen/manuscript_beta2_single_fiber.git
cd manuscript_beta2_single_fiber
```

### 2. 🐳 Install Docker (if not already installed)
```
#Linux:
sudo pacman -S docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```
On macOS or Windows, download from [`Docker website`](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### 3. 📦 Download the docker image
```
docker pull sorenjessen/b2a_res_single_fiber:latest
```

### 4. ▶️ Run the analysis from within the root of the repository

This command will mount your local 'raw-data' (input data), 'R' (scripts), and 'data' (output files such as Figures etc.) folders into the container and run the full pipeline:
```
#On linux/max
bash run_docker_unix.sh

##On Windows
##You may need to run PowerShell as admin and run
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

#...followed by
./run_docker_win.ps1

```

This will automatically:

- Mount the necessary folders (data-raw, R, data)
- Run the Snakemake workflow with 1 fewer core than your system’s total
- Write the output to the local data/ folder

You can modify the analysis scripts in the local R/ folder and rerun the command. The pipeline will automatically rerun only the necessary steps based on file dependencies.
